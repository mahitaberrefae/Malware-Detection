Graduation Project
This is my graduation project, under supervision of Dr. Khaled Fouad Elsayed and Dr. Husam Kinawi. And technically supported by Dr. Dina Salem.

The project briefly is a bout Android malware detection system using a deep learning technique called graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). The network works on android applications. Some information about the application is extracted and added to the windows event log of the server containing the network.

This is the main server which is a part of a local area network that contains a number of computers that send their windows event logs to Elastic Stack. The Elastic Stack is used to visualize this data on a browser to do some further analysis.
